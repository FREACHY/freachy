				CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

			<div class="title">CSS Solved a Big Problem</div>
    
		<p>
			HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
		</p>
		<p>
			HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
		</p>
		<p>
			< h1 >This is a heading< /h1 >
		</p>
		<p>
			< p >This is a paragraph.< /p >
		</p>
		<p>
			When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
		</p>
		<p>
			To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
		</p>
		<p>
			CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

<div class="title">CSS SYNTAX</div>
<p>
1. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
</br>
2. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
</br>
3. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
</br>
4. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
</p>
<p>
	EXAMPLE EXPLAINED
</p>
<p>
	• p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: < p >).</br>
		• color is a property, and red is the property value</br>
		• text-align is a property, and center is the property value
</p>

<div class="title">CSS Selectors</div>
<p>
	CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
</p>
<p>
	We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
</p>
<p>
	1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class) 
	2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
	3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
	4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
	5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
</p>

			CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.

			This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.

			The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.

			At this point, we've looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to correctly arrange your boxes in relation to the viewport as well as to one another. We've covered the necessary prerequisites, so let's dive deep into CSS layout, looking at such various features as: different display settings, positioning, modern layout tools like flexbox and CSS grid, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.
